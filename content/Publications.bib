  abstract = {Oil whirl and whip phenomena are fundamental to rotor systems supported by journal bearings. Published studies opt for a reduced formulation of the Reynolds equation of lubrication in order to aid the computations. In the current study, the complete Reynolds equation is solved using Pseudo Spectral Methods (PSM) and results compared with reduced solutions. The possibility of certain trends being missed in reduced model simulations is also brought out using a simple example. Rotor shaft and journal bearing systems are numerically modelled and coupled simulations have been carried out for test rotors inspired from literature. A semi analytical derivative estimation method is demonstrated to be superior to conventional finite difference methods in terms of processor load. This will be a useful addition for iterative solvers applied on rotors with more complicated geometry. Time transient analysis is carried out for two test rotors in order to bring out the oil whirl and whip phenomena, where the second one, with an added nonlinear node, shows a whirl along a branch which went undetected in the published reference. In the light of the above trends, the importance of full model numerical simulation is further emphasized.},

  abstract = {Joints are a well-known source of nonlinearity in assembled structures, introducing amplitude-dependent stiffness and damping properties that are active areas of research in the community. The origins of these nonlinearities are understood to be frictional contact interactions between the members that are joined together. Due to the fact that frictional contact involves the gradual degradation and/or damage of the material in contact, the nonlinear influences of the joints on the system-level dynamics are constantly changing. At the level of the joint interfaces, this phenomenon is referred to as wear and there are numerous studies, mainly in the contact mechanics/tribology community, advancing the theoretical understanding of the various factors contributing to it. Tribomechadynamics is an emerging field seeking to syncretize research work in these fields with structural dynamics, with an aim to improve the state-of-the-art when it comes to structural dynamics models of assembled structure. The present study is conducted in this spirit, drawing from the understanding that the system-level dynamical properties of any jointed system are described by phenomena ranging from the material descriptions of the contacting interfaces including the grain structure and boundaries, plastic-flow, etc.; micro- to meso-level features of the interfaces such as asperities distributions, mean surface curvature, etc.; to macro-level features such as the geometry of the assembly, loading path, assembly misalignments, etc. While other studies focus on developing efficient computational approaches spanning the various factors above, the present work is aimed at making experimental observations of the joint-wear phenomenon affecting the global dynamics of a jointed structure. The paper presents the results of an experimental campaign consisting of 12 hours steady-state periodic excitation, with interferometry scans of the interface made at different intervals of time across the study. The tests were conducted on a three-bolted lap joint benchmark structure known as the Brake-Reu{\ss} Beam (BRB). The BRB employed here was freshly manufactured for the purpose of this study, and the interface showed signs of significant wear as well as degradation of the dynamical properties at the end of the experimental campaign.},

  abstract = {Harmonic Balance is probably the most popular method for computing both periodic and quasi-periodic vibrations. To treat hysteresis in the periodic case, a marching procedure is commonly used where the evolution law that governs the hysteresis is incremented in discrete time until the steady cycle is reached. In the present work, this marching procedure is generalized to the quasi-periodic case. The numerical examples demonstrate the superior computational performance of the proposed approach over the state-of-the-art. The latter requires the representation of internal variables defining the hysteresis state, which have discontinuous derivatives, whereas the remaining variables are two-times continuously differentiable. This leads to the Gibbs phenomenon and poor convergence, while the proposed method achieves higher accuracy and a typical computational speedup by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude. The proposed approach is illustrated for the case of the popular Jenkins element; the application to other models of mechanical hysteresis and non-mechanical hysteresis problems seems easily possible.},

  abstract = {The Surrogate system hypothesis for jointed mechanics proposes that the influence of a jointed interface on an otherwise linear system is identical irrespective of the structural features of the so-called far-field linear structure. The implication, if the hypothesis finds support, is that the characterization of a joint in a single structural context can be used for developing predictive models of completely different structures, albeit with identical joint configurations. In critical applications such as aerospace, this can potentially lead to a more cost-effective design flow enabling tighter design optimization. In order to evaluate the hypothesis, the major influences on the nonlinear behavior of a jointed structure has to be delineated and studied individually as well as in combinations. Proceeding in the spirit of previous investigations where the effect of far-field structures and joint interface modeling approaches have been tackled, the current investigation studies the so-called ``modal surrogacy'' of a structural system. The investigation serves to understand the sufficiency of modeling the nonlinear behavior in lower modes to make high-modal nonlinear predictions. The Brake-Reu{\ss} Beam (BRB), which is an assembly of two monolithic beams connected together using a bolted lap joint with three bolts, is used as a test specimen for the current investigations. Due to the presence of regions with zero static pre-stress in the interface, considerable separation combined with stick \& slip has been numerically as well as experimentally observed. This leads to significant nonlinear effects in the response of the system and thus serves as a convenient benchmark for the current work.},

In the current study, a modified approach, based on He's Energy Balance Method (EBM), is applied to obtain the periodic solutions of conservative systems. It is shown that by this approach, periodic solutions of conservative systems on iso-energy manifolds in the phase space can be obtained very efficiently. The energy level provides the additional constraint on the HBM formulation, which enables the determination of the period of the solutions.},

  abstract = {In the present article, we follow up our recent work on the experimental assessment of two data-driven nonlinear system identification methodologies. The first methodology constructs a single nonlinear-mode model from periodic vibration data obtained under phase-controlled harmonic excitation. The second methodology constructs a state-space model with polynomial nonlinear terms from vibration data obtained under uncontrolled broadband random excitation. The conclusions drawn from our previous work (experimental) were limited by uncertainties inherent to the specimen, instrumentation, and signal processing. To avoid these uncertainties in the present work, we pursued a completely numerical approach based on synthetic measurement data obtained from simulated experiments. Three benchmarks are considered, which feature geometric, unilateral contact, and dry friction nonlinearity, respectively. As in our previous work, we assessed the prediction accuracy of the identified models with a focus on the regime near a particular resonance. This way, we confirmed our findings on the strengths and weaknesses of the two methodologies and derive several new findings: First, the state-space method struggles even for polynomial nonlinearities if the training data is chaotic. Second, the polynomial state-space models can reach high accuracy only in a rather limited range of vibration levels for systems with non-polynomial nonlinearities. Such cases demonstrate the sensitivity to training data inherent in the method, as model errors are inevitable here. Third, although the excitation does not perfectly isolate the nonlinear mode (exciter-structure interaction, uncontrolled higher harmonics, local instead of distributed excitation), the modal properties are identified with high accuracy.},

  abstract = {Tribomechadynamics is an emerging field seeking to advance the theoretical understanding of the dynamics of jointed structures by considering the influences of physical phenomena at different length scales (micro-level tribology, meso-level contact, and macro-level geometrical features). The current work presents a fully physics-based modeling approach attempting to make blind predictions of the near-resonant dynamics of a bolted joint through non-intrusive scans of the contacting interfaces aloe (from an interferometer). Drawing inspiration from earlier work, the study presents a novel rough contact modeling approach that considers micro-scale asperity distributions along with meso-scale interface geometry (surface topology) for the contact-constitutive modeling. The developed framework is validated against hammer impact tests conducted on a three-bolted lap joint benchmark structure known as the Brake-Reu{\ss} Beam (BRB). The results demonstrate that the current framework can predict the linearized (low amplitude) natural frequencies of the first three modes with an accuracy of less than 0.25\%. The model, however, seems to yield relatively inferior predictions when it comes to the nonlinear trends, characterized here as amplitude-dependent resonant frequency and damping. The Rayleigh-Quotient based Nonlinear Modal Analysis (RQNMA) technique is employed for all the simulations. In order to explore the sensitivity of the model to errors/deviations in the parameters assumed (or measured), Polynomial Chaos (PC) based uncertainty propagation studies are undertaken. The factors studied in this stochastic manner are: the micro-level contact model parameters, bolt prestress levels, and deviations in the meso-scale topologies of the contact interfaces. Initial results indicate that the response is most sensitive to the micro-level contact model properties. Finally, the blind predictions of the model are also assessed for the case of a damaged beam, in which case the model performs relatively poorly in the quantitative sense, although capturing the qualitative trends satisfactorily well. It is inferred, from these observations, that further improvements in the micro-scale contact model are necessary in order to develop a modeling approach that is capable of predicting the dynamics of structures with considerably worn/damaged contact interfaces.},

  abstract = {Non-linear Modal Analysis (NMA) refers to a class of analysis procedures that seek to characterize nonlinear dynamical systems similar to how classical linear modal analysis characterizes the natural frequencies and mode shapes of linear systems. The current study proposes an extension to the stationarity of Rayleigh quotients, a classical technique for linear modal analysis, for non-linear, non-conservative, dynamical systems. The approach, termed Rayleigh Quotient-based Nonlinear Modal Analysis (RQNMA), formalizes each mode as a finite non-trivial perturbation about a static solution that is locally stationary in the work done. Apart from offering a theoretical basis for the concept of non-linear modes, this circumvents several limitations in previous methods (for example, Quasi-Static Modal Analysis (QSMA)), such as inconsistencies in handling static forces, assumptions on mode-shape change, etc. As with other NMA procedures, RQNMA is formulated for the characterization of the amplitude-dependent natural frequency (stiffness) and damping ratio (dissipation) near/at the resonances. The estimated stiffness and dissipation characteristics are compared with modal backbones generated from frequency-domain approaches, which typically are computationally more expensive than the presented approach. Comparisons are conducted using different benchmark models, placing special emphasis on structures with pre-stressed frictional contacts, in order to bring out the strengths and shortcomings of the presented approach to contextualize its applicability.},

  abstract = {One strategy to develop both accurate and computationally tractable models of jointed structures is reduced order modeling through hyper-reduced representations of the interfaces in contact. Hyper reduction refers to reduction techniques that result in a Reduced Order Model (ROM) that is complete by itself, i.e., all displacements and forces are fully described in the ROM coordinates directly. Focusing primarily on applications involving small relative displacement contacts, two fundamentally different approaches are formulated and compared for merits and limitations in applicability. The first is an adaptation of the stiffness-preserving RBE3 constraint elements, and the second is an interpolation approach based on remeshing the interface. Although RBE3 is extensively used in the literature, the current formulation derives stiffness preserving elements that are specifically useful for contact dynamics applications. Transformations are developed to express force--displacement relationships in the ROM coordinates that are congruent (in the sense of using the same contact models) as well as consistent (in the sense of being faithful to the quantities involved) with a high-fidelity model of the same structure. These approaches are applied to study a three-bolted lap-joint structure (the Brake-Reu{\ss} Beam (BRB) benchmark) that has been observed to demonstrate characteristic contact non-linearities. Multiple strategies for the hyper reduction are evaluated, including graph partitioning, finite element coarsening, and homogenization of field objectives, some of which involve an extra step of remeshing/choosing patches based on a field objective (e.g., contact pressure). The performances of the ROMs are assessed by conducting nonlinear modal analysis and computing a posteriori error metrics.},

  abstract = {The main challenges in the design and analysis of jointed structures deal with the prediction of dissipation across bolted interfaces. Since friction is thought to be one of the main mechanisms for this, the current study investigates the utility of frictional parameter identification applied across different structures. Based on recent discoveries, a Surrogate System Hypothesis has been formulated to systematize this: the hypothesis states in brief, that the physical properties of a joint are independent of its structural context. The current work seeks to obtain a better understanding of the underlying systems by evaluating a confidence metric for the hypothesis for a relatively simple set of systems---physically perturbed configurations of the Brake-Reu{\ss} Beam. Interfacial friction is modeled using whole jointed patches with distributed hysteretic (Iwan) elements and simulations are conducted using the Quasi-Static Modal Analysis (QSMA) approach to estimate the modal characteristics of the system response (amplitude dependence of natural frequency and dissipation). Posing the estimation as a Multi-Objective Optimization Problem (MOOP) is shown to reveal important features of both the employed constitutive model as well as the structure that is modeled. Consequently, the approach is used to evaluate the epistemic uncertainty inherent in three different friction models. The studies reveal that a confidence metric for the hypothesis can be formulated in such a way that it is nearly independent of the friction constitutive model that is employed.},

Using rough contact theory, it is possible to establish fundamental constitutive relationships with parameters estimated from micro-scale surface scans. Such a model is employed in the framework for a three bolt lap-joint benchmark (the so-called ``Brake-Reu{\ss}-Beam''). Since the characterization of the interface is conducted in a full-field manner on top of a finite element mesh, the framework is also demonstrated to be applicable for conducting full-field micro-scale interface evolution studies.

  abstract = {In this paper, we develop two wave-based approaches for predicting the nonlinear periodic response of jointed elastic bars. First, we present a nonlinear wave-based vibration approach (WBVA) for studying jointed systems informed by re-usable, perturbation-derived scattering functions. This analytical approach can be used to predict the steady-state, forced response of jointed elastic bar structures incorporating any number and variety of nonlinear joints. As a second method, we present a nonlinear Plane-Wave Expansion (PWE) approach for analyzing periodic response in the same jointed bar structures. Both wave-based approaches have advantages and disadvantages when compared side-by-side. The WBVA results in a minimal set of equations and is re-usable following determination of the reflection and transmission functions, while the PWE formulation can be easily applied to new joint models and maintains solution accuracy to higher levels of nonlinearity. For example cases of two and three bars connected by linearly damped joints with linear and cubic stiffness, the two wave-based approaches accurately predict the expected Duffing-like behavior in which multiple periodic responses occur in the near-resonant regime, in close agreement with reference finite element simulations. Lastly, we discuss extensions of the work to jointed structures composed of beam-like members, and propose follow-on studies addressing opportunities identified in the application of the methods presented.},

Not only does this accurately determine stability of the periodic solutions found in the example case of two bars connected by a nonlinear joint, but it directly governs the response and stability of parametrically forced continuous systems without resorting to discretization, a new development in of itself. In the second stability approach, we pose a perturbation eigenproblem residue (PER) and show that changes in the sign of the PER locate critical points where stability changes from stable to unstable, and vice-versa. Lastly, we discuss follow-on research using the developed stability approaches. In particular, we identify an opportunity to study stability around internal resonance, and then identify a need to further develop and interpret the PER approach to directly predict stability.},

  abstract = {Recent experiments with the Brake-Reu{\ss}-Beam (BRB), a three-bolt lap-jointed benchmark system, have shown that neither the contact pressure nor the contact area are constant within the interface during oscillation, two traditional assumptions made for modeling bolted structures. Thus, it is important to preserve interfacial kinematics and represent the underlying physics in a consistent fashion to develop consistent computational models. Most consistent formulations tend to result in large model sizes and thus make computations for large structures nearly intractable. However, there have been multiple efforts at interface reduction. Most of these formulations though, have the disadvantage of having to deal with large number of points for the nonlinear force calculations. The current study proposes an interfacial reduction approach that is both consistent with the kinematics and at the same time does not require transformations to the original coordinates. Based upon this framework, the current work also compares different criteria for the reduction procedure. The method is demonstrated to improve the efficiency of nonlinear simulations (conducted using two different approaches), with little to no sacrifice in accuracy.},

One of the greatest obstacles in developing predictive models is a lack of understanding of the relative epistemic uncertainties (model form errors) inherent to different choices of contact constitutive modeling approaches. The contact constitutive models affect the stiffness and hysteresis of the contact resulting in different frequency and damping properties. Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) is applied to find solutions that minimize the deviation in both frequency and damping from experimentally measured properties. Then the concept of non-domination of design parameter sets is used from MOO approaches to develop a quantitative understanding of the epistemic uncertainties, i.e., the inexactness of each approach to represent experimentally measured properties. The current study investigates the uncertainty associated with conventionally popular simplified approaches such as the use of phenomenological models (e.g., Iwan or Bouc-Wen models) and constitutive models (e.g., Jenkins models) within a whole-jointed framework.},

Unlike monolithic structures, the addition of friction in joints introduces nonlinearities in the vibration response of the structure. Frictional contact models can be applied to reproduce the nonlinear behavior, but the best predictive modeling framework is not clear. Elastic dry friction is a popular choice for predictive modeling, but recent work has highlighted its inability to recreate experimental behavior. As an alternative, several microslip rough contact models have been derived from distributions of asperity heights. Unlike elastic dry friction, these models have a smooth transition from sticking to slipping allowing them to capture smoother experimental trends. However, these models have often used the Masing assumptions and constant (over the interface and a cycle) normal pressures. The assumption of constant normal pressures neglects the kinematics of jointed interfaces, while the Masing assumptions do not generally hold for normal pressures that vary throughout a cycle. The present work seeks to further develop a microslip rough contact modeling framework without the simplifying assumptions to realize more physical simulations. Experiments on a benchmark structure, along with interfacial scans, are used to assess the validity of the proposed modeling framework.},

However, it is unclear which models are best suited for fitting or predicting the responses of structures. The present study evaluates 26 friction model/interface representation combinations to quantify the model form error. A Quasi-Static Modal Analysis approach (termed Rayleigh Quotient Nonlinear Modal Analysis) is adopted to calculate the nonlinear system response, and a Multi-Objective Optimization is solved to fit experimental data of the first mode of the Brake-Reu{\ss} Beam. Optimized parameters from the first mode are applied to the second and third bending modes to quantify the predictive ability of the models. Formulations for both tracing full hysteresis loops and recreating hysteresis loops from a single loading curve (Masing assumptions) are considered. Smoothly varying models applied to a five patch representation showed the highest flexibility (for fitting mode 1) and good predictive potential (for modes 2 and 3). For a second formulation, which uses 152 frictional elements to represent the interface, the physically motivated spring in series with a Coulomb slip model (elastic dry friction) has high error for fitting mode 1 and performs near the middle for predicting higher modes. For both interface representation, the best fit models are not the most physical, but rather the ones with the most parameters (as expected); however, the more physical models perform somewhat better for predicting the higher modes.},

One such condition that is of particular interest is loading nanomaterials under tension at high strain rates. Understanding such high strain rate (i.e. 100 s 1 to 10,000 s 1) behaviors of nanomaterials can help bridge long-standing experiment-simulation gaps, improve nanocomposite engineering, and enhance nanomaterial selections for different applications under extreme conditions. In this study, a proven method for quasi-static tensile tests at the nanoscale is adapted for higher strain rates. Using a new actuation method, strain rates of 585 {\textpm} 215 s 1 were achieved using poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) nanofibers as a validation material. However, this method cannot measure a force. Comparing tests conducted at quasi-static strain rate to high strain rate, the failure strain of PMMA nanofibers decreases by a factor of 1.5 as the strain rate increases. The advantages of the method developed in this study include its proven track record at the quasistatic strain rate, simplicity, and ability to test any optically visible nanomaterial at high strain rates.},

Quasi-linearization, in this context, refers to the fact that it is possible to approximate weakly nonlinear systems as linear systems parameterized by some measure of their response amplitude. The paper formalizes this by describing the forced response by an amplitude-dependent transfer function written in a rational fraction polynomial form. The coefficients are estimated through a regularized iterative identification approach based on frequency-domain measurements. An {$L$}0 regularization is used to promote sparsity/model simplicity, and a bi-objective optimization approach is developed for its tuning. Apart from serving to obtain an accuracy-sparsity trade-off, this procedure allows for a minimal realization of the transfer function that is also physically meaningful. Following analytical explorations on a Duffing oscillator, the developed framework is applied to three experimental benchmarks, encompassing geometrically nonlinear, frictional, and multi-physics interactions. The performance of the method is assessed in its ability to describe the fixed displacement forced response surfaces. Furthermore, the identified models are used to synthesize fixed excitation forced response and compared against measurements to obtain additional insights.},
