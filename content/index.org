Welcome to the website of the Vibrations and Nonlinear Dynamics Laboratory.
Our motto is simple:
#+begin_center
*If it oscillates, we'll study it!*
#+end_center

We're always on the lookout for motivated students (Bachelors,
Masters, and PhD) and scholars (for a Postdoc) who are fascinated by
vibrations & dynamics and would like to try their hand out in
research. Our door is always open to discuss research
possibilities.

You can have a look at the research tab to get a general sense of the
types of projects we like to work on. However, we are not closed to
suggestions for new topics/areas! :)

** Upcoming Projects

The following is a (non-exhaustive) list of specific projects I plan
to actively seek funding for in the short-term:
*** Stochastic Process Approaches For Predictive Constitutive and Damage Modeling of Rough Surfaces
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: roughsurf
:END:

Modeling rough surfaces as stochastic processes has been shown to lead
to scale-independent descriptions of rough surfaces. We argue here
that if such parameters are scale independent and therefore "features"
of the surface, it MUST be possible to relate characteristic
constitutive quantities to these features.

Furthermore, stochastic process models of surfaces seem to imply that
one can write down a Stochastic Difference Equation (SDE) describing
the structure of the surface features with length-scale being the
independent variable. Preliminary studies in the literature indicate
that this implies a "hierarchical" structure, with the largest
length-scale features (read: macro-scale) influencing the intermediate
scales (meso-scale) influencing the smallest scales (micro-scale
roughness).

With the pursuit of this project, I hope to develop a clearer
description of the different scales in the description of a rough
surface and their relative contributions to the overall ("macro")
dynamics of a jointed system.

*** Reduced Order Modeling of Structures with Frictional and Geometric Nonlinearities
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: rom
:END:

In most applications involving frictional interfaces coupled to
geometrically nonlinear sub-domains (panels riveted/bolted at its
ends, etc.), it can be observed that the former are not geometrically
nonlinear and latter (large displacement/strain) do not undergo
contact under nominal operation. Therefore it makes sense to employ
smooth reduced order modeling approaches (orthogonal polynomial
projections, etc.) for the latter sub-domains and non-smooth
approaches for the former sub-domain.

It has been a standard observation that contact interfaces show
non-trivial evolution wherefore employing smooth polynomial fields is
not the best way to go. It is my impression that strategies based on
adaptive mesh-refinement are perhaps the way to go to improve
computational performance in contact problems. Unlike earlier studies,
I hope to directly use the governing partial differential equations
for conducting the mesh-refinements, rather than using a finely
resolved finite element mesh as reference.

*** Time Scale Decomposition for Thermo-Mechanical Problems
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: tsdec
:END:

A fundamental observation that can be made in thermo-mechanical
vibration problems is that the *elastic/mechanical portion* of the
problem is governed by a *hyperbolic* PDE that leads to
oscillatory/harmonic solutions, while the *heat equation is parabolic*
with considerably larger time constants.\\
Application of time-scale decomposition is a promising framework for
dealing with such coupled problems. For example in frictional systems,
the vibration response will be accounted for by the fast dynamics and
the energy dissipated as heat will be accounted for by slowly evolving
envelopes. Thermal fluxes from the environment can also be considered
under such a framework as having a direct influence on the
vibrations.\\ 
Mathematically this will be achieved by using a singular perturbation
framework leading to harmonic balance for the vibrations and a first
order system for the slow dynamics.

*** Nonlinear Modal Testing as the Next Paradigm in Industrial Modal Analysis 
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: nlmtesting
:END:

Nonlinear Modal Analysis has gradually started becoming reasonably
mature in academic circles over the last two decades. Unlike linear
modes, nonlinear modes allow characterization of modal characteristics
(natural frequency, damping factor, mode-shape) as response-amplitude
dependent features of the system. Substituting the employment of
classical linear modal analysis in the industrial setting has all
indications of being the next paradigm in the community.

Computational and experimental advances have ensured that analysis as
well as experimental characterization of nonlinear modes do not pose
prohibitive expenses (as compared to conducting linear
analyses/experiments) any longer. Since the scientific advances have
matured, technology adoption is the next step. This research will
involve the following aspects (which will ideally be achieved by at
least 3 candidates):
+ Implementation and validation of nonlinear modal solvers in
  industrial finite-element software;
+ Implementation and validation of nonlinear modal testing methods
  (Phase Locked-Loops, Control-Based Continuation) for industrial test
  cases;
+ Addressing lingering theoretical questions pertaining to
  mode-mixing, modal interference, etc.

** Ongoing Projects

Here is a list of on-going projects at various stages of completion. 
*** Neimark-Sacker Bifurcations in Forced-Self Excited Frictional Systems
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: linlof
:END:

Self excitation is often observed in aeroelastic systems where the
aerodynamic influences lead to energy being added into the sytem in a
state-dependent fashion. The resulting instabilities are saturated, in
practical applications, by mechanical contacts undergoing frictional
dissipation. We develop a novel fully frequency domain approach for
the bifurcation analysis of such systems. An imporant aspect of the
approach here is that no theoretical conditions are violated for the
stability analysis eventhough the systems are fundamentally non-smooth
(dry friction modeled using non-smooth relationships).

*** Application of Nonlinear Modal Methods for Narrow-Band Random Excitation
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: randomexc
:END:

Thus far, nonlinear modal methods have found applications only in
periodic response regimes. We are trying to understand the efficacy in
random response regimes in this projects.

The evolution of the slow envelope is written in terms of a Stochastic
Differential Equation (SDE), and solving the corresponding Fokker
Planck Equations (FPE) allows us to identify the diffusion of the
probability density of the envelopes directly.

*** Identification of Micro-Slip Hysteretic Models from Frictional Response Measurements
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: hystid
:END:

We deal with the fundamental problem of identifying hysteretic models
that best fit measurements made from a tribometer developed at the
University of Stuttgart. Although several models exist in the
literature, robust identification poses several challenges due to
epistemic issues characteristic of friciton modeling.

*** An Averaging Approach for the Stability of Periodic Responses
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: avstab
:END:

Pursuing the spirit of the method of multiple scales and time-scale
decomposition, we have shown that it is indeed possible to rigorously
write down slow-time evolution equations for the Fourier coefficients
of a nonlinear oscillator. Unlike classical Floquet theory which
requires smoothness and is thereby inapplicable to frictional contact
problems, the averaging approach has lesser theoretical constraints,
making it more generally applicable.

*** Modal Interactions in the Presence of Multiple Nonlinear Modes
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: mmodes
:END:

Accounting for the coexistence of multiple nonlinear modes in a single
response has been an enduring problem in the nonlinear modal analysis
literature. It is becoming clear that ignoring multi-modal effects in
system identification leads to several inconsistencies. We are
conducting a theoretical analysis to understand this phenomenon
better.

*** Wave-Expansion Modeling of Rotors, Frames, etc.
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: wbmmod
:END:

We recently developed a suite of wave-based analysis tools (see [[https://nidish96.github.io/wavevib][here]]
for a MATLAB/OCTAVE toolbox) that are generally applicable for
periodic and quasi-periodic responses of 1D continuum structures. The
main advantage here is that the approximations obtained are _spatially
exact_, with errors coming only from the temporal (Fourier)
approximations. This results in a computational approach that is
*several orders of magnitude faster* than conventional techniques such
as finite elements, etc., while assuring superior accuracy.

We are looking to demonstrate the applicability of this method to
+ Rotordynamic problems with nonlinear bearings, contact, etc.,
+ Spatial frame structures with industrial applications.

Theoretically, we are also trying to see if an averaging concept is
applicable to analyze the stability of the resulting solutions.

** Past Research

Here is a list of past research projects.
*** Torus-Time Marching for the Evaluation of Hystereses Under Quasi-Periodic Responses
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: qphyst
:END:

Hysteretic forces (specifically rate-independent laws) are often
represented as differential relationships. Evaluation of these
requires an incremental implementation based on discretizing the
differential operators. For periodic response calculations (using
Harmonic Balance, for instance), imposing periodicity as a constraint
leads to an iterative implementation that is repeated until
convergence. In this work we generalized this idea to the
multi-frequency "quasi-periodic" case.

  forced response of a frictional oscillator]]. 

*** A Sparse Parameterized Identification Approach for Weakly Nonlinear Systems
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: spident
:END:

Decoupling the dynamics of a weakly nonlinear oscillator into
fast-varying dynamics and slowly-varying amplitudes leads to a
theoretical framework referred to as quasi-linearization. When the
amplitude is kept constant, the system dynamics ends up behaving in a
linear manner. Conducting testing (forced response, for instance)
while controlling the response amplitude (adjusting force
appropriately) leads to fully linear responses. Repeating such tests
for multiple amplitude levels has been shown to allow one to paint an
accurate picture of the dynamics of the system.

In this work, we used this framework to develop a novel transfer
function identification methodology. The transfer function is
dependent, apart from the $s$ parameter, also on the response
amplitude. Solving the resulting problem using sparse regression leads
to a computationally attractive system identification method for
weakly non-linear systems.

*** Wave-Based Modeling for the Periodic Response and Stability Analysis of Jointed 1D Structures
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: wbmpaper
:END:

In this work we developed a suite of techniques, based on wave
propagation representations on 1D bars and beams, to analyse the
periodic responses and stability of jointed 1D structures. The main
advantage with the wave-based approach is that it is spatially exact
and the approximations are introduced from the time-representation
only. A semi-analytical approach based on singular perturbation and a
numerical approach based on plane-wave expansions were formulated and
applied.

For stability analysis, a generalized strained-parameter approach
using singular perturbations and a numerical approach based on sign
changes in the determinant are proposed. It must be noted that these
stability analysis approaches are capable of detecting simple
bifurcations (fold-type, period-doubling) but will not work for
Hopf-type bifurcations (Neimark-Sacker). A MATLAB/OCTAVE toolbox named
[[https://nidish96.github.io/wavevib][WaveVib]] has been created based on this work, which is aimed to allow
fast prototyping with a versatile "front-end".

*** A Deep Neural Network Approach for Experimental Modal Analysis Using Video Measurements
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: deepdic
:END:

Digital Image Correlation (DIC) has emerged as the new standard in
video-based vibration testing. In this work, we established, firstly,
a framework for conducting Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA) using DIC
measurements for a system under electrodynamic excitation. Although
DIC provides full-field data, the main drawback holding it from
wide-spread applicability is that post-processing is a rather
expensive process. We therefore adapted (fine-tuned) an existing deep
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to substitute the DIC computation
in the EMA application and demonstrated that such Neural Networks can
indeed substitute DIC, with some examples showing even a 15x increase
in computational performance.

*** A Stochastic Approach for the Quantification of the Effects of Non-Unique Residual Tractions in Frictional Systems
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: nonuniq
:END:

Frictional interfaces are classically known to be statically
indeterminate under nominal loads (until the "slip limit"). For
structures with multiple joints wherein the tangential restoring
forces from one joint influences the normal loading conditions of
another joint, this indeterminacy manifests in a very pronounced
manner, making the system exhibit non-unique solutions. Employing a
mathematical parameterization of this effect for the elastic
dry-friction element, we analyzed this effect from a stochastic
perspective (using PCE) in the context of other possible uncertainties
in frictional joints. It was observed that the influence of this
non-uniqueness is most pronounced in the micro-slip regime.

*** Long-Term Evolution of the Dynamics of Jointed Structures
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: ltermw
:END:

Wear and friction related damage is a rather obvious expectation from
mechanical joints. Capturing such phenomena quantitatively is,
however, an enduring challenge in the joints community. We conducted a
12-hour experimental campaign studying the evolution of the dynamics
of a jointed system. Frequency response and hammer impact-based
nonlinear modal tests were conducted to characterize the
dynamics. Interferometry was used to obtain height maps of the
interfaces to characterize roughness. Continuous periodic excitation
was provided at a near-resonant condition to induce wear in the
interface.

:PROPERTIES:

We applied a statistical rough contact approach to conduct predictive
nonlinear modal analysis of a bolted structure and compared this
against experimental measurements. Frequency accuracy within 5% and
damping accuracy within 25% were achieved. We also employed
*Polynomial Chaos Expansion* for uncertainty quantification.

*** Hyper-Reduction for Jointed Interfaces
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: hred
:END:

Hyper-reduction in the context of Reduced Order Modeling (ROM) refers
to the development of ROMs wherein the model evaluation can be
conducted completely without transforming the system back to the Full
Order Model (FOM). Most projection based ROMs require one to first
transform the reduced Degrees-of-Freedoms (DoFs) to the FOM domain for
the evaluation of nonlinear forces (interfacial friction, for
instance). We developed two novel hyper-reduction approaches for
interfacial reduction of jointed systems.

The first technique is based on the so-called Spider
elements/distributing coupling elements. These formulations are
modified to be tailor-fit to flat interfaces and relevant constitutive
models are also developed. The resulting "whole-joint model" provides
a highly compressed representation of the original system, wherein the
forces and moments on the "patches" represent specific traction
distributions on the original interface. 

The second technique is based on remeshing the interface and
constructing the projection matrices in a manner that allows one to
evaluate the nonlinear forces fully in the reduced mesh. The way we do
this here is to evaluate the projection operators completely based on
quadrature points of the reduced mesh. While this leads to a special
left projector matrix for the vector of nonlinear forces, it
completely avoids having to transform the system back to the original
domain.

*** A Quasi-Static Generalization of Rayleigh Quotient Extremality for Nonlinear Modal Analysis
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: rqnm
:END:

The most popular techniques for nonlinear modal analysis involve
either transient shooting or Harmonic balance (which also involves
transient evaluation). More recently quasi-static simulations, under
certain assumptions, have been shown to lead to an approximate but
efficient approach for nonlinear modal analysis. These were termed
Quasi-Static Modal Analysis (QSMA) and have found applications in
several practical examples.

In this work we went back to linear vibration theory where linear
modes are defined as the minimizers of Rayleigh quotients, which are
quadratic functions of the states. For weakly nonlinear systems,
making a near-quadratic assumption for a generalized Rayleigh quotient
leads to a completely new concept of nonlinear modes. Here, we apply
the principle of virtual work (since energy can't be defined
consistently for dissipative systems) and obtain a set of quasi-static
equations with a scalar constraint. The constraint introduces a
Lagrange multiplier as an additional unknown, which is interpreted in
congruence with linear vibrations (where $\lambda=\omega_n^2$).
