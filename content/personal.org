** AS3020: Aerospace Structures
*** Terms Taught
1. Jul-Nov 2024

*** Course Content
+ Determination of loads acting on major airplane components (wing, fuselage, tails).
+ Analysis of wings.
  + Shear centre.
  + Bending and torsion of closed and open tubes.
  + Multi-cell tubes.
  + Columns and beam-columns.
  + Bending and buckling of plates and sheet stringer combination.
+ Analysis of fuselage.
  + Learn about the main aircraft structural components, to introduce the concept of semi-monocoque construction in aircraft, discuss different loads acting on an aircraft, concept of airworthiness and generation of a safety-flight envelope (known as ‘V-n’ diagram).
  + Modelling the components in terms of 1-D or 2-D structural elements.
  + Analysis of thin-walled open and closed section beams under bending, shear and torsional loads.
  + Bending and buckling of plates and sheet-stiffener combination.
+ Structural idealization of wings and fuselage and preliminary analysis.
